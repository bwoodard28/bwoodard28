# <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bricewoodard/">Brice Woodard</a>'s IT and Cybersecurity Project Portfolio üîê

My work focuses on security operations, vulnerability management, and governance, risk, and compliance. I build hands-on projects that show how technical findings connect to business risk and compliance requirements. This portfolio includes vulnerability management programs, compliance mapping, risk registers, cloud security labs, and integrations. Each project is designed to produce practical, audit-ready deliverables.
